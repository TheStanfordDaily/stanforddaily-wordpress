Organize thousands of WordPress media files in folders / categories at ease.


== Description ==
FileBird is a media file manager plugin to help you organize WordPress media library folders by drag and drop.

It allows you to create virtual folders to contain your WordPress media library. So when you move files and folders, that won’t break permalinks to your images in the content.

With FileBird Pro you can save time on WP media management, search for any file & folder, sort them out, add folder gallery, etc. That’s a great way to improve your admin workflow and productivity.

###⛩️ HOW IT WORKS
Are you a WordPress website administrator?

Managing a WordPress site means that you’ll be adding tons of multi-media files such as images, videos, audios, documents, etc., into your WP media library.

As a result, your library has to store thousands of files and could become a total mess. WordPress default file name search function is a good thing but it will never match the ease of going directly to a folder. That’s when FileBird comes in to help with managing files in WordPress!

This media file manager gives you the ability to easily organize all files by drag and drop between folders. With FileBird in hand, things will be a lot better than they were.

The best thing about a folder-based structure is it makes it very easy to find the files you need and saves you so much time.

You won’t see WordPress media library not loading, as FileBird smart-loads one folder at a time.

###🚀 Tips to manage WP media folders like a pro with FileBird

* Give files and folders logical, specific names
* Nest folders within parent folders
* Resize the left sidebar to get an overview of all folders
* Upload files to a specific folder by choosing the folder from the **drop-down**
* Easily **search** for the name of file/folder right on the sidebar
* From the page/post composer, **browse** files and folders in the FileBird UI
* Use FileBird block gallery to insert multiple media files in a page, post, and custom post type
* Keep your folders uncluttered by clearing out the old files using **Sort features**
